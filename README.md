# CausalHR
 
This is a repository for the CausalHR package, used to estimate the causal hazard ratio. This package accompanies the following paper "Sensitivity analysis for the causal hazard ratio in randomized and observational studies" by Rachel Axelrod and Daniel Nevo (arXiv link pending).

This package is based on a fork of the muhaz package from CRAN. We updated the muhaz R function and Fortran code to allow observation weights to be used when estimation the hazard function. The muhaz package was originally authored by Kenneth Hess, R. Gentleman and David Winsemius, and is available [on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/muhaz/index.html).
